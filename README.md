Secure Login & Signup System
Project Overview

This is a secure login and signup system built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, bcrypt, and zxcvbn.
It enforces strong password policies, hashes passwords before storing, and provides real-time password strength feedback to users.

Features

User signup with password validation:

Minimum 8 characters

At least 1 uppercase letter

At least 1 number

At least 1 special character

Password strength meter using zxcvbn

Secure password hashing using bcrypt

Login authentication

Frontend and backend validation

Responsive and clean UI with CSS
